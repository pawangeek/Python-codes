# Spanning tree: That connect all vertices together
# MST: That connect all vertices with minimum weight

# If there are V -> vertices in graph
# Than there are V-1 edges in MST

"""
Algorithm

1. Sort all edges according to their weight
2. Pick smallest weight edge check if it form cycle
    2.1 If cycle then discard it
    2.2 Else include it

3. Repeat step 2 for rest V-1 edges
